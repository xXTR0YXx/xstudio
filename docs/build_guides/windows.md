## Install basic tools
---

To build XStudio on Windows, you need to install some basic tools. The Windows build uses VCPKG to install third-party dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. First, ensure that you are using an [administrative](https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/) shell.

2. Install MS Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is fine) [Visual Studio Legacy Installs](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).

3. Restart your machine after Visual Studio finishes installing

4. Execute the script `setup_dev_env.ps1` located in the [script/setup](/scripts/setup/setup_dev_env.ps1) folder.

## Install Qt 5.15

To install Qt 5.15, follow these steps:

1. [Download](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss?hsCtaTracking=99d9dd4f-5681-48d2-b096-470725510d34%7C074ddad0-fdef-4e53-8aa8-5e8a876d6ab4) the Qt Windows installer.
2. Execute the installer.
3. During the installation, select the components as shown in the following picture: By default these legacy options are not available. You need to choose "Archive" then "Filter" to get access to this version of QT

4. The installation may take some time. You can grab a cup of coffee while it completes.
5. Note that you will need a valid username and password to download Qt. The installer allows you to add or remove components in the future.
